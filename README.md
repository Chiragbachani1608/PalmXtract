Built an AI-driven application for real-time palm line detection using MediaPipe (deep learning-based hand tracking) and OpenCV.
Implemented advanced image processing techniques like adaptive thresholding and edge detection to enhance palm line clarity.
Designed the system for dynamic palm image capture with potential applications in biometrics and gesture recognition.
Key Technologies: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Machine Learning
